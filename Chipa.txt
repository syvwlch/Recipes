INGREDIENTS:

1000 g 		tapioca starch 		(optionally with 10% substitued with fine corn meal)
 500 g 		paraguayan cheese 	(or a mix of whatever tangy, melty cheese you want)
 250 g 		lard, warm & soft	(freshly home rendered is tastier, of course)
   2   		eggs
   1 tbsp	salt
  25 g		aniseed
as needed	milk

Pre-heat oven at 475F.
Mix everything but the starch in a big bowl until smooth.
Work in the starch and knead, adding (a little) milk as needed until you get a play-doh like consistency.
Roll out into thumb-thick snakes about two palm-widths, and curve into doughnut.
Score tops.
Bake 15 minutes, plus 3-5 minutes with broiler on, keeping an eye to prevent burning.

Objective is an soft, cheesy center with some stretch in a hard crust. 
Best hot and fresh from the oven!
